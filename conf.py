# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions or modules to document with autodoc are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
# sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../src'))  # Adjust as needed

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. 
# These extensions are optional but useful for Read the Docs.


# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.
# Use the Read the Docs theme for better compatibility with Read the Docs.
# html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets)
# here, relative to this directory. These files are copied after the built-in
# static files, so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the built-in one.
